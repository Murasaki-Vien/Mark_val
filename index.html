          Hello, Nay Milagros and Papa Dionnel. Since it's almost Valentine's Day,
          it's a great opportunity for me to express my love and gratitude for
          everything you have given me throughout my life. Even though it's not
          much, this is the only thing I can do to show my love to you, my
          parents.
        </p>
